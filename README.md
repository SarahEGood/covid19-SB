# COVID-19 Case Data (San Bernardino)

A Jupyter notebook exploring COVID-19 case data for San Bernardino County, California. I was following the COVID-19 updates from the San Bernardino County updates via email and wanted to know if I could investigate the data myself too.

## What's in the Notebook?
So far, I have quick graphs of:
* Total Cases Confirmed by day
* New Cases per day
* Suspected (Hospital) COVID patients per day

## How to View
You can view and run the notebooks online [directly on Github](https://github.com/SarahEGood/covid19-SB/blob/master/San_Bernardino_COVID-19_Data.ipynb) or pull from this repo.
