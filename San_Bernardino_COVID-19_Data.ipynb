    "**Updated: 6/16/2020**\n",

    "Data provided by California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal: [California COVID-19 Hospital Data and Case Statistics](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/california-covid-19-hospital-data-and-case-statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rationale\n",
    "I'm a resident of San Bernardino County and have been receiving COVID-19 updates from [the county's email newsletter](https://wp.sbcounty.gov/cao/countywire/) regarding the pandemic. Typically, the newsletter will display increases in confirmed COVID cases and deaths as percentage increases from the previous day. I thought this might be pretty deceiving since the percentages would need to decrease overtime to show a decrease in spread, whereas a constant percentage would mean the disease would still be killing and spreading at an exponential rate. So, I decided to dive into the data myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing situation, so our analysis is likely to change overtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Data\n",
    "So before we can do any serious analysis, let's look at the first few columns of our data."
